# Portfolio
This is my portfolio, a project set by _nology to present my skills and experience to potential employers. More than that, this project has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, SCSS, and BEM, as well as styling considerations for a web app. 

**This project has:**
- a header, an intro, an about me section, a technical skills sections,  a projects section, and a footer.
- a mobile view, tablet view, and laptop view to ensure it is fully accessible on multiple devices. 
- Several considerations were also made to make the site as accessible as possible, allowing for high lighthouse scores.

**Future implementations:**
- Of course, fill it up with projects!
- I would like to add some hover features to the project buttons like for the header button. Doing so would mean having the icons in a darker colour and setting their display to none when the cursor is not on the button.
- Add functionality to the menu so it drops down.
- Playing around with different fonts and some other styling elements.

**How to install the project:**
- Open your terminal and locate the directory you want to place it in.
